<!-- allow_dynamic_fields(true): When attributes are not defined as fields but added to an object, they will get fields added for them dynamically and will get persisted. If set to false an error will get raised when attempting to set a value that has no field defined.
identity_map_enabled(false): When set to true Mongoid will store documents loaded from the database in the identity map by their ids, so subsequent database queries for the same document in the same unit of work do not hit the database. This is only for relation queries at the moment. See the identity map documentation for more info.
include_root_in_json(false): When set to true mongoid will include the name of the root document and the name of each association as the root element when calling #to_json on a model.
include_type_for_serialization(false): When set to true this will tell Mongoid to include the "_type" field when serializing to JSON and XML.
preload_models(false): Tells Mongoid to preload application model classes on each request in environments where classes are not being cached. Specify an array of class names when enabling, only to the classes that use inheritance.
protect_sensitive_fields(true): Mongoid by default will auto protect '_id' and '_type' from mass assignment. Set this to false if you are daring with your application's security.
raise_not_found_error(true): Will raise a Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound when attempting to find a document by an id that doesnt exist. When set to false will only return nil for the same query.
skip_version_check(false): If you are having issues authenticating against MongoHQ or MongoMachine because of access to the system collection being not allowed, set this to true.
scope_overwrite_exception(false): This will instruct Mongoid to raise an error if you define a scope with the same name as an existing method.
use_activesupport_time_zone(true): When in a Rails app will tell Mongoid to convert all times in the application to the local defined time zone in Active Support.
use_utc(false): Instructs Mongoid to convert all times to UTC times in all cases. -->
